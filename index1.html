            Long Essay on Organic farming 600 Words in English
            Ever since there has been urbanization and industrialization, the population explosion has also been in one of the causes of concern for environmentalists and governments alike. To fulfil the hunger of our growing population, harmful agricultural practices have been employed to increase crop production and decrease the time of production through artificial ways. These ways include the use of chemical fertilizers, harmful pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides to improve the production rate of the crops. While these techniques might help farmers to improve their yield, they are short-sighted in nature and can cause poisoning of the food we consume. Hence organic farming is the ultimate solution to prevent this disaster upon human civilisation.
            
            Organic farming is a technique in which cultivation of land takes place through sustainable manner using natural resources like air, water and soil. Organic farming does not necessarily mean that man-made chemicals are not used. In many organic farming methods, man-made fertilizers and pesticides are used not to improve crop production but to improve soil fertility. Which means that these chemicals are going directly into the soil and not into the food we consume. The difference between organic and inorganic farming is that in organic farming the chemicals help improve soil fertility and does not percolate into the crops but in inorganic farming, the chemicals degrade the soil fertility and make the soil barren after agricultural output and also results in these chemicals percolating into the food and ultimately into our food chains. Harmful chemicals such as zinc, lead and manganese that are present in pesticides and herbicides are consumed by human beings which can have grave dangers on our health.
            
            Some of the major advantages of organic farming are that the production of healthy and quality agricultural output is relatively more as compared to inorganic farming. Also, organic farming is environmentally friendly since it helps improve soil fertility and thereby the repeated usage of that particular patch of land for agricultural purposes is possible. This, in turn, helps in reducing deforestation caused due to agricultural practices. Other advantages of organic farming is that the pricing of organic output in the market is high which means that the profit margin for the farmer is also hight. This sustained method of agriculture helps farmers in maintaining a constant and judicious balance of crop yield and saving our environment. Another biggest advantage of organic farming is it helps to prevent soil pollution.
